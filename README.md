# Welcome to your Donewithit app ðŸ‘‹

This project is a small virtual store where users can post products they want to sell and potentially buy used items at a lower price. It was originally developed using Expo, JavaScript, and default React Native styles. 

My main objective with this project is to apply the best concepts and practices of mobile development with React Native, using technologies such as TypeScript, React Query, React Context, Styled Components, and native APIs from Expo. Tests will also be added.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn 
   ```
2. Start backend server locally 

   ```bash
   Clone the repository from this link (https://github.com/MarcosCunhaDev/donewithit-server) and run it locally.
   ```


3. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```


In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
